# KMUTT-CPE111-2017-2
Nathaphop's work from KMUTT CPE 111 class.

Because it is a description file that I can derived from [windu.cpe.kmutt.ac.th](windu.cpe.kmutt.ac.th)

## Command
You can go through each directory and then use these commands to run the code.

### GCC Compiler

And you can clean all file by using `make clean`
